              According to the output of a
              research report by Western Michigan University published in 2005,
              an e-commerce website does not have to be good looking with
              listing on a lot of search engines. It must build relationships
              with customers to make money. The report also suggests that a
              website must leave a positive impression on the customers, giving
              them a reason to come back.[40] However, resent research[41] has
              proven that sites with higher focus on efficiency, convenience,
              and personalised services increased the customers motivation to
              make purchases. Dyn, an Internet performance management company
              conducted a survey on more than 1400 consumers across 11 countries
              in North America, Europe, Middle-East and Asia and the results of
              the survey are as follows: Online retailers must improve the
              website speed Online retailers must ease consumers fear around
              security These concerns majorly affect the decisions of almost two
              thirds of the consumers.[42]
